TD 9 has been upgraded to Tropical Storm #Ida.  Satellite imagery presentation continues to improve as Ida slowly strengthens.  More moderate, if not rapid, intensification likely once in the Gulf due to favorable conditions (warm water, high ocean heat content, healthy outflow). https://t.co/B4Nqo7R9i1

No need to scare people, but folks along the northern Gulf Coast need to be reviewing (or putting together) storm evacuation plans right now. The quick timing may catch some people off guard. The risk of significant surge, high winds, and coastal/inland flood is real. #Ida https://t.co/00DO5rE057

Ida will likely be named as the NEXT tropical storm soon, perhaps even later today.

The "I" storms are the most retired name for all names, by the way.

7 AM CT (8/27/21): Hurricane Hunters find Tropical Storm #Ida stronger. Winds up to 60 mph. Satellite appearance shows a healthier storm. This will be a dangerous hurricane once it moves into the Gulf of Mexico. @WBRCnews https://t.co/vt1Ut5xY0t

Tropical Storm #Ida continues to slowly organize in the Caribbean this morning. Structure looking healthier compared to yesterday. Will be interesting to see how this storm evolves over the next 48 hours. Landfall likely somewhere along Louisiana coast Sunday evening. @WBRCnews https://t.co/Ym1vnPS7Ht

Ida is looking healthy tonight with more banding features and a better outflow as shown from GOES IR tonight. It's still organizing and even though it's a 40-50 mph Tropical Storm, organizing now could play a huge factor long term when it hits the gulf. 1/? https://t.co/JqQXojf2rw

I have a terrible question, but I‚Äôm morbidly curious. If you‚Äôre on a ventilator in the hospital, and the hospital is hit by a storm like Ida. Is your death attributed to Covid, Climate Change, or both?

Also: Hospitals in the Southeast are running low on oxygen, with the worst-hit areas (like Louisiana) left with only 12 to 24 hours worth. If Hurricane Ida disrupts the supply chain at all, the results could be cataclysmic.

Ida update: I'm currently seeing the remnants of the storm pass through. What remains of the eye is well east of me, so it's more a gentle caress than a natural disaster. Hard to stress how slowly this storm is moving and how bad that is for those unaccustomed with these things.
