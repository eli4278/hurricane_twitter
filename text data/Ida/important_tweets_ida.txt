The storm struck as hospitals and their intensive care units are filled with patients from the fourth surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, sparked by the highly contagious delta variant and low vaccination rates across Louisiana. https://t.co/n3921FuXq5

Both Louisiana and Mississippi's hospital systems neared the brink of collapse this month &amp; remain overwhelmed with COVID-19.
Minutes ago, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a category 4 hurricane‚Äîthe strongest in the region since the 1850s. https://t.co/vC2qe5ZI3a

"..the system's six hospitals will go into lockdown mode Sunday morning. The staff who were going to stay at the hospitals for the duration of the storm were coming in Saturday and Sunday morning and would sleep at the hospital.":/ https://t.co/v1mILUgsgP

"Why is charging $50 for a $6 case of water during a hurricane considered price gouging, but charging $700 for a $5 vial of insulin is considered health care?"
