How many are going to die when hurricane Ida knocks out power to hospitals and unvaccinated Covid patients don't have respirators.

How many will have no hospital beds to go to after the storm.

What have you done to yourselves and those around you.

So all or most of those people in the ICU with COVID in Louisiana that‚Äôs in the eye of the storm are probably gonna die if the storm knocks the power out in the hospital.

Would they be included in the death toll of Hurricane Ida or from COVID-19?

It‚Äôs a long road to recovery post Hurricane Ida but having my family with me for the past week has been something positive that came out of the storm.

Thank you to @MS_aquarium for giving us a tour of the campus and treating us with that special South Mississippi hospitality! https://t.co/su29EkBLEg
