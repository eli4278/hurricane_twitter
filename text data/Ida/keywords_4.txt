I'm OK after yesterday's flooding/tornadoes/remnants of Hurricane Ida. It was quite shocking to see how much damage NJ got- it was definitely the worst storm to hit here since Sandy! Only a tiny bit of flooding in the basement. We didn't lose power or have any downed trees. (1/2)

RT @seattletimes: Ida was the fifth most powerful storm to strike the U.S. when it hit Louisiana on Sunday with maximum winds of 150 mph (240 kph), likely causing tens of billions of dollars in flood, wind and other damage, including to the electrical grid.

Ida cost $95 billion in one storm.  If a terrorist did that much damage, we would be spending trillions EVERY year to stop any similar attack in the future.

@BellaBo08281673 Yes. I agreeee. Receiving more vaccine is a great thing.
New Orleans is 957 miles S. Of Chgo.  So we are nowhere near the flooding.  We are lucky. We had a bad storm go through a couple weeks ago so now we are looking at hail damage. But that is very minor in comparison to Ida

@BellaBo08281673 Yes. I agreeee. Receiving more vaccine is a great thing.
New Orleans is 957 miles S. Of Chgo.  So we are nowhere near the flooding.  We are lucky. We had a bad storm go through a couple weeks ago so now we are looking at hail damage. But that is very minor in comparison to Ida

Your vote against investigating the presidential election has done more damage to Louisiana than Ida or any storm

We are on the brink of a climate catastrophe, and storms like Ida will only become more frequent if we fail to act. This storm system claimed 50 lives, and its damage will cost approximately $85 million. Acting on climate change is not ‚Äútoo expensive‚Äù. https://t.co/CFqguuYlQw https://t.co/vVdF6umIxn

Category 4 hurricane Ida has dissipated, but not before it caused damages equal to $50 billion. Ida is the 2nd strongest storm to hit Louisiana state right after Katrina. Ida caused massive amounts of flooding in the Northeastern U.S. and is the 6th costliest hurricane to date.

Don't dismiss this threat of a tropical storm. Remember Ida caused significant problems aft all the way into the Northeast due to flash flooding and tornadoes. And in 2016, there was significant flooding from a storm that wasn't named.
