Hurricane #Ida is dangerous, strong and will cause mass damage to NOLA, parts of Mississippi and Alabama. The path of this storm scares me tremendously because hospitals in these areas are already full and there are far too many people w/o funds or transportation to evacuate https://t.co/vZLQUoTTKP
