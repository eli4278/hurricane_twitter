@DidacticFlannel It looks like PR dodged Dorian's bullet. It's 90 miles N of PR, moving NE and is projected to turn and hit Florida where hopefully it will fizzle. They've reinforced hospitals and all have generators in PR so some rain and wind but nowhere like a Maria. Fingers crossed. Smile.

@KenCalvert What are you and the Trump administration doing to help the Bahamas Ken? You've planned ahead and sent the hospital ship Comfort I assume. What else?

Miami is helping. So is Chef Andre. How 'bout the Trump administration? Anything Ken?

RT @LifeSouth: Please donate O- blood if you are able so that we can maintain supply for area hospitals affected by Dorian. All types are needed, but 0- is needed most critically.

This week was definitely different. The park was gearing up for Dorian. It miss us.
Sending out prayers to everyone who has been affected by this terrible storm.
This week, Danny ended up in the hospital. Yeah, not what either of us were expecting.

RT @tal7291: #DORIAN #BAHAMAS
USDOD needs to send the #hospital_ship_MERCY to help with medical care and a ship that can make and bottle water.
USN is taking vessels out to sea from Hampton Rds and Little Creek - send some of them to BAHAMAS to help with critical infrastructure.
