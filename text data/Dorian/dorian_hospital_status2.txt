I would be able to breathe a little easier. Pay off my debts a little quicker. Be able to afford hysterectomy in an MOE hospital so I can get it done sooner instead of waiting until August next year in an MOH hospital (my actual surgery date).

And much much more. https://t.co/vrS2a1DGUD

@DidacticFlannel It looks like PR dodged Dorian's bullet. It's 90 miles N of PR, moving NE and is projected to turn and hit Florida where hopefully it will fizzle. They've reinforced hospitals and all have generators in PR so some rain and wind but nowhere like a Maria. Fingers crossed. Smile.

Saw some stories saying a hospital in FL says the pressure from #Dorian caused women to go into labor.

Did a quick Google search- seems like there's debate as to if its the pressure or the stress.

Either way... 9 months from now, probably have a lot more babies...
